2. Description

UMounter is just for mounting all your removeable volumes, that will be plugged
in to your computer. For example: If u stick in an usb mass storage which
includes a valid filesystem, this filesystem will be mounted on linux to /media.

U have to unmount it by yourself, cause for this time UMounter only mount this
devices, but if you plugg out your mass storage device data could be lost.

For later releases it is planned to take in a config file in /etc, which could
run several commands when a new volume is mounted. But for this time, u have to
life without this feature if u want to use UMounter.

UMounter uses the UDisks over glib and gio to mount the volumes. I was created
mainly for slim desktops like openbox. This slim desktops don't have any
automounter for mass storage devices so an implemention could be usefull.
There are also other programs out there which solves this issue, but nothing
connecting over gio to UDisks, as far as i had seen.

3. Requirements

If you COMPILE UMounter, cause u don't get a package for your distribution or
for any other reason, you need the following programs:

    - cmake > 2.8
    - gcc
    - make
    - glib headers

And for INSTALLING you need the following libs:

    - glib > 2.26
    - libdbus

For USING UMounter the following requirements exist:

    - a running dbus daemon for connection to udisks

All other requirements should be installed on every distribution you get. If not
please tell me, so i can add other requirements!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Installation

First switch to the directory and build your umounter with:

    @host]$ cmake && make

now u can isntall it with a simple:

    @host]$ make install

If u want to decide to which prefix UMounter should be installed, try this:

    @host]$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr && make

Now u can use your umounter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Use

Just start your damon as user with 
    
    umounter &

In later release u will have the option to set it as system wide daemon. But for
this time... this must be ok.
